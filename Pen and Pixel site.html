        <div class="row">
        <p>Pen and Pixel is an annual creative multimedia exhibition held by the students of Limerick Institute of Technology in Clonmel. This year the event will be held on Thursday the 22nd of May at 6.00pm in the Clonmel campus of Limerick School of Art and Design. The annual event has slowly transformed into a spectacular end of year exhibition. As part of the exhibition, we are showcasing the work of students from the past year. This exhibition will feature both digital and analogue pieces from the students of LSAD Clonmel. </p>
        
        <p>The exhibition allows students to showcase their creative talents to the public. In the past, the event has been known as Digital Expressions and since 2011 the name has been changed to Pen & Pixel. It was felt that this new name better reflected the creative process of designing and then creating a piece of work. This year there has been a particular emphasis placed on showcasing both digital and analogue work, spanning the entire range of the multimedia sector.</p>
